# Naya-Project-1
First project of the data science course


This is the first project of the data sience course at Naya College.
The objective of the project is to consolidate some basic python knowledge

The desing was dictated as part of the problem definition.

Assumptions:
- The type used for the name of the nodes is immutable and supports __eq__ and __nq__ methods
- The nodes in the graph may be connected to nodes not in the graph. Operations on the graph should not fail a cause of this
- The nodes of a graph could be modified outside the graph. The grap hold references to the node objects.
